# Security Reflections
> Personal learning log combining **academic reflections** and **CTF write-ups**


# About This Repository
This repository documents my continuous learning process in cybersecurity from university modules and self-reflections to hands-on practice through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

It aims to connect **theoretical understadning** (from academic coursework)
with **practical problem-solving skills** (from CTF and labs)
